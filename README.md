## Hi, pleasure to meet you ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nicholas Dale, an aspiring data professional who used to be a nursing student. 

ðŸŒ± Recently graduated from a Data Analytics Bootcamp, currently a Data Science student in university, with hopes of gaining a Master's degree in Health Data Analytics to marry my technical and healthcare experiences together. 

ðŸ”­ Currently working on refining my data analysis skills through application to several open-source datasets. Check it out [here](https://github.com/falconpunch082/industry-application/tree/main)!

ðŸ’¡ I am currently interested in applying a humane touch in medical conversational AI.

### More about me

- While Python is my first language I've mastered, my **actual** first language is Java - I learned it from a maths tutor when I was 15 and curious about the world of coding!

- Besides data, I am passionate about computer and arcade games, music (especially Japanese idol music), anime, photography, coffee and mental health.

- I believe in the principle of self-improvement and being better than yesterday.

- System.out.println("Love Live for life <3");
